Investigation of undesirable holding of references to various forms of JSF @ViewScoped beans by navigation type

Author: Darren Kelly (Webel IT Australia, https://www.webel.com.au)

This mini test web app is for demonstration and investigation of when or whether 
@PreDestroy methods are called and whether garbage collection succeeds for various 
forms of @ViewScoped JavaServer Faces (JSF) beans. It accompanies these forum postings:

This NetBeans IDE 8.2 project may be deployed to the bundled Glassfish 4.1.1 web app server
(or to an additionally installed Payara41 web app server). Download from:

- http://www.netbeans.org (required)

- http://www.payara.fish (optional)

You may have to set your own web application server under Properties > Run.


MOJARRA JSF IMPLEMENTATION VERSION

Currently the web app is for demonstration against the Mojarra 2.x JSF implementation series.
Use the JSF Mojarra version bundled with NetBeans8.2/Glassfish4.1.1 or install a recent version:

- Use Maven or download javax.faces.jar directly from:

-- Releases: https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/org/glassfish/javax.faces/

-- Snapshots: https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/snapshots/org/glassfish/javax.faces/
 
(Visit also https://javaserverfaces.java.net/2.2/download.html.)

To install by hand, stop your web app server and copy the Mojarra JAR to:

.../NetBeans-8.2/glassfish-4.1.1/glassfish/modules/javax.faces.jar
.../NetBeans-8.2/payara41/glassfish/modules/javax.faces.jar

Then restart your server:

- The test web app interrogates the Mojarra version live and displays it in the header of each web page.


JAVA VERSION

For use with Java7 or Java8:

- The test web app interrogates the Java version and displays it in the header of each web page.


DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

You will need a tool for diagnosing memory use and references to instances of JSF beans:

- You can use the Profiler within NetBeans IDE.

- Optionally - if not already bundled with your JDK as 'jvisualvm' - 
  download and install VisualVM from https://visualvm.github.io/


ON USE OF OMNIFACES

This test web app compares JSF and CDI bean view scopes with the 3rd-party OmniFaces JSF toolkit view scope:

- An OmniFaces library is included with the project under ./lib

- Please visit and read also: http://showcase.omnifaces.org/cdi/ViewScoped


ON USE OF JSF VIEW SCOPE CONTEXT PARAMETERS

In web.xml the application is set to use:

    com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession 4

    com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews 4


By default this OmniFaces-specific parameter is commented out:

    org.omnifaces.VIEW_SCOPE_MANAGER_MAX_ACTIVE_VIEW_SCOPES


The javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD defaults to 'server'.



HOWTO RUN AND USE THE TEST WEB APP


STEP: Open the project in NetBeans IDE and the Project Properties:

- Under Libraries set the Java Platform to JDK1.8 (if available), otherwise JDK1.7.

- Under Run set the server to Glassfish4.1.1 or Payara41 (if installed).

-- Be sure to check that you choose a server with the desired Mojarra version installed (see above).

The folder ./nbproject/private is NOT distributed with the test web app, so these settings are local.


STEP: clean and build.

The procedure is then slightly different depending on whether you use 
VisualVM (recommended) or the NetBeans built-in Profiler.


If using VisualVM:

- Run the project, it should start your web app server and deploy the test web app,
  which will open in whatever web browser you have set as default in NetBeans IDE.

- Then (after it has launched) run 'jvisualvm' from a terminal command line.

- In VisualVM you'll see 'GlassFish' as a process (Payara also runs as 'GlassFish').

- Open that 'GlassFish' process (use right click context menu).

- Click on the Monitor tab and note how you can observe the 
  Garbage Collection (GC) activity under CPU (top left)

- Choose the Sampler tab then Memory.

- Note how there is a button to Perform GC.

- Under the Class Name Filter at the bottom enter 'com.webel.jsf'

-- Initially you will only see one instance of a helper class: com.webel.jsf.JavaUtil.

-- Later (once you start loading test pages) you will see instances of various @ViewScoped beans.


If using NetBeans IDE Profiler:

- DO NOT use the usual Run button, use instead Profile (right click context menu on Project node).

-- This will run the project in profiling mode (and usually restarts the web app server too).

- Under the Profile toolbar button use the pulldown (small down array right of Profile button)
  to choose Enable Multiple Modes then Telemetry (gives an overview) and Objects.

- Click the settings gear wheel icon (top right).

-- Choose to Profile Selected classes, then select these 3 classes:

    com.webel.jsf.Jsf20ViewBean, com.webel.jsf.Jsf23ViewBean, com.webel.jsf.OmniViewBean

    Instances for them won't be shown in the Profiler until you choose a matching test page.

- Note how there is a rubbish bin icon/button for invoking Garbage Collection.



DIAGNOSING THE VARIOUS JSF @ViewScoped BEANS

The initial web page is an index to 3 test cases, one for each of the bean forms below:

    import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean;
    import javax.faces.bean.ViewScoped; // OBSOLETE JSF2.0 style
    @ManagedBean
    @ViewScoped
    public class Jsf20ViewBean extends AbstractViewBean {



    import javax.inject.Named;
    import javax.faces.view.ViewScoped; // CDI-compatible JSF2.3 version
    @Named
    @ViewScoped
    public class Jsf23ViewBean extends AbstractViewBean {



    import javax.inject.Named;
    import org.omnifaces.cdi.ViewScoped; // 3rd party CDI-compatible
    @Named
    @ViewScoped
    public class OmniViewBean extends AbstractViewBean {


Each test page creates (usually) a new @ViewScoped bean when first loaded.
Of interest is what happens to referenced beans once the view page is left
(whereby the result depends on the bean type and navigation method used).

- Concern1: Are any @PreDestroy invoked so there is an opportunity to clean up resources ?

- Concern2: Can the @ViewScoped bean itself be garbage collected ?

-- Concern2a: Can the @ViewScoped bean be immediately garbage collected ?

-- Concern2b: Can the @ViewScoped bean be garbage collected later 
    (such as when the logical number of view is hit, or the session ends) ?

VERY IMPORTANT: The test web app here is primarily for immediate garbage collection (Concern2a),
and while it can be used to investigate (Concern2b, later collection) the published test results 
don't address that aspect !

IMPORTANT: in order to observe when and/or whether @PreDestroy is invoked
and whether a bean is garbage collected you will need a systematic approach:

1. Use the Perform GC function in your profiler BEFORE loading each test page.

2. Invocations of @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy methods are logged to the server console.
   Use the NetBeans server log console window, and clear it BEFORE loading each test page
   and AFTER navigating away from each test page (but not before first noting the output).

3. Use the Perform GC function in your profile AFTER navigating away from each test page.

You must be vigilant and watch carefully the number of instances of each bean type
in your profiler at each stage.


ABOUT THE TEST PAGES AND NAVIGATION CASES

Each test web page has hopefully clear instructions.

Each test page (for each different @ViewScoped bean type) offers the same
selection of navigation cases for leaving the view scope and landing at
a target page done.xhtml (which page does not use any view scoped beans).

Access a desired test page initially from the top-level index page (Home),
which page likewise does NOT use or create any view scoped beans.

There are 3 basic subsets of navigation cases:

1. GET related navigation cases (no form): h:link, h:outputLink, and HTML <a>

   (Please ignore the distinction between links with and without redirects,
    that is for investigating something unrelated to the main concerns.)

2. Form based navigation cases: 
  
   - h:commandButton with action String and h:commandButton with action method return String.
 
   - A special case is remaining on the same view scoped page using 'null' navigation.

3. Web browser's page reload action.

(An additional special case, not included in the results table, is a GET on the web browser URL,
which case might be used during facelets development, but is not usually used by novice users.)


After navigating away from a test page to the target page you may:

- Navigate back to the previous view scoped test page (or another).

- Navigate back to the top-level home page (index.html).

Again: be aware of diagnostics in both your profiler and server log window at all times.
